Startline is a super-skinny WordPress Theme that acts as a starting point for new themes that use both [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/). It also comes bundled with the [HTML5 Shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv) and [Respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) utilities. The CSS is written using Sass.

Requires at least: WordPress 4.6. Tested up to: WordPress 4.6.1

## Installation

1. Download the theme from this ZIP
2. Navigate to the theme's directory on the command line and run the following command: ```
$ cd wp-content/themes/startline
$ npm run build
```
3. Activate the theme within the WordPress admin panel
4. Get customising.

## Customising

### CSS

Edit the Sass files within the `scss/` directory and run the Sass watch command

`$ sass --watch scss/main.scss:css/main.min.css`

### Favicons

The favicons are generated by [realfavicongenerator.net](http://realfavicongenerator.net/)

### npm

If you wish to include the npm modules within your project's repository you'll need to edit the `.gitignore` file and remove the `node_modules` line.

### Don't forget

Don't forget to change `screenshot.png` and the theme meta data in `style.css`.

## Building

To build the site ready for production, run the following command. This installs all required packages and saves and minifies the CSS files.

`$ npm run build`
