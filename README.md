Startline is a super-skinny WordPress Theme that acts as a starting point for new themes that use both [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/). It also comes bundled with the [HTML5 Shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv) and [Respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) utilities. The CSS is written using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).

Requires at least: WordPress 4.6. Tested up to: WordPress 4.6.1

## Installation

 - [Download the theme from this ZIP](http://ninefortyone.co.uk/startline/latest.zip)
 - Extract the ZIP archive into your WordPress install's Theme directory
 - Activate the theme within the WordPress admin panel
 - Get customising.

## Customising

### CSS

Edit the Sass files within the `scss/` directory and run the Sass watch command

`$ sass --watch scss/main.scss:css/main.min.css`

### Favicons

The favicons are generated by [realfavicongenerator.net](http://realfavicongenerator.net/)
